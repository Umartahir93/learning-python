The Ivorian winger arrived in north London as a club-record signing and concedes that it has taken him a while to feet his feet in English football
Nicolas Pepe believes things are “definitely going better” for him at Arsenal on the back of a slow start to his time in England, but the £72 million ($94m) winger admits he still has “room for improvement”.

Big things were expected of the 24-year-old Ivory Coast international when he arrived in north London.

Having starred with Lille in Ligue 1, sparking a scramble for his signature, the exciting forward was considered to be quite a coup for the Gunners.

He has, however, struggled to live up to his billing and club-record price tag, with just five goals recorded across 25 appearances in all competitions.

There have been signs of encouragement of late, with Mikel Arteta offering a clean slate to those at Emirates Stadium, and Pepe feels his learning curve is heading in the right direction.

He told reporters ahead of a derby date with Chelsea on Tuesday: “Things are definitely going better.

“I am still learning and there is plenty of room for improvement, but in terms of understanding, things are definitely becoming easier.

“Mikel has explained exactly what he would like me to do on the pitch and shown me videos that have stressed the importance of my positioning. He’s told me what he would like me to do to help me progress as a player.”
